# boot-hoplon [![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red.svg)](https://github.com/hoplon/hoplon/pull/151)

[](dependency)
```clojure
[hoplon/boot-hoplon "0.3.0"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

[Boot] task for building [Hoplon] web applications.

## What's In The Box™

* Generate HTML page and CLJS namespace from Hoplon `.hl` file.
* Prerender application HTML in PhantomJS.
* Generate HTML page according to namespace metadata in regular `.cljs` files.
* Provides extended `ns+` form to make namespace declarations work in `.cljs`
  files the way they work in `.clj` (that is, `:use` and `:refer` work as in
  Clojure and there is no need to use `:require-macros`, `:use-macros`, or
  `:refer-macros` --- it just figures out what to do automatically).

## Usage

Add `boot-hoplon` to your `build.boot` dependencies and `require` the namespace.

> **Note:** the boot-hoplon dependency is only needed at when compiling Hoplon
> source files, but hoplon itself is needed both when compiling and at runtime.
> So you should add boot-hoplon with the _test_ scope and hoplon with the
> (default) _compile_ scope.

```clj
(merge-env!
  :dependencies '[[hoplon "A.B.C"]
                  [hoplon/boot-hoplon "X.Y.Z" :scope "test"])
(require '[hoplon.boot-hoplon :refer :all])
```

You can see the options available on the command line:

```bash
boot hoplon -h
```

or in the REPL:

```clj
boot.user=> (doc hoplon)
```

## Compile Hoplon Pages

If you only want to compile Hoplon &rarr; ClojureScript+HTML, you can do:

```bash
boot hoplon
```
